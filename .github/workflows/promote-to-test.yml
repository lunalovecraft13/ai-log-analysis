# This GitHub Action automates the process of simulating code promotion to the "Test" environment
name: Promote to Test Stage

# Trigger the workflow every time code is pushed to the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # You can change this if your dev branch has a different name

jobs:
  promote-to-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # This job runs on a virtual Ubuntu machine

      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code so it can be used in the workflow
